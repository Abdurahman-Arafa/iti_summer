# This is my Laravel App 
where I apply what I've learned about Laravel

</br>

## what i've learned so far:
    - MVC architecture
    - Routes
    - Controllers 
    - Middlewares
    - Factories and Seeders
    - Authentication
    - Eloquent model

# Routes in this App:
    - '/' opens the Laravel default page.
    - '/login' opens a Custom Login page the logged in user is redirected to '/products'.
    - '/register' opens a custom Register page then logs in the user and redirects to '/products'.
    - '/products' opens a CRUD operation page for the Products table.
    - '/home' can be accessed by clicking the App logo. Opens the default Laravel dashboard.
    - '/admin' a dump of the user data, can only be accessed if the User's name is 'admin'. (done by using a custom middleware 'isAdmin')

# To Run This App
1- I used Laragon to Run the local server, you can get it from [laragon.org](https://laragon.org/download/index.html). you can use [pretty URLs](https://laragon.org/docs/pretty-urls.html) from it</br>
2- make sure 'composer' is installed, if not install it from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/). </br>
3- in your terminal `cd` to the project folder and run `composer install` then run `npm install`. </br>
4- Create a copy of your .env file by running `cp .env.example .env`.</br>
5- Generate an app encryption key by running `php artisan key:generate`.</br>
6- create an empty database with the same credentials in the .env file or update them with your own.</br>
7- Migrate the database using `php artisan migrate` to create the tables in the database.</br>
8- Seed the database using `php artisan db:seed` to Populate the tables with data.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
